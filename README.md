# pyacptrak

## What is it?

**pyacptrak** helps you to create ACOPOStrak resources for projects, training, meetings, mappView widgets, etc... It is a powerful tool when used together with Jupyter-Lab (Or Jupyter Notes) but could be used as stand alone module.

## Main Features

### Work with segments (Segment class)

The library support the 4 type of segments ('AA', 'AB', 'BA' and 'BB')

Obtain segment information:

```
from pyacptrak import *

print(Segment('aa').info)
```

Output:
```
{'length': 660,
 'type': '8F1I01.AA66.xxxx-1',
 'description': 'ACOPOStrak straight segment'}
```
Plot segment:
```
from pyacptrak import *

Segment('aa').plot()
```

The plot function supports rotation in degrees
```
from pyacptrak import *

Segment('ab').plot(-45)
```

### Work with tracks (Track class)

The library has 5 types of pre-built tracks (TRACK0, TRACK45, TRACK90, TRACK135 and TRACK180)

```
from pyacptrak import *

TRACK135.plot()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158949482-f06e91bc-f8b9-4e11-b0fc-a7fe1149a15e.png)

<pyacptrak.pyacptrak.track at 0x17daec2f250>

But you could also build your own tracks using individual segments

```
from pyacptrak import *
track1 = (Segment('aa') * 2) + Segment('ab') + (Segment('bb') * 2) + Segment('ba')
track1.plot()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158949973-eea998ae-32fc-491f-955c-c5fbef496978.png)

<pyacptrak.pyacptrak.track at 0x17daf060700>

Or using the pre-configured tracks

```
from pyacptrak import *
track1 = (TRACK0 * 2) + TRACK135
track1.plot()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158949973-eea998ae-32fc-491f-955c-c5fbef496978.png)

<pyacptrak.pyacptrak.track at 0x17daf060700>

The plot function supports rotation for tracks

```
from pyacptrak import *
track1 = (TRACK0 * 2) + TRACK135
track1.plot(15)
```

### Work with loops (Loop class)

The library supports working with loops, the arguments for the loop are width and height, the unit is considering the 660mm grid so a `loop(2,1)` would draw the smallest possible loop

```
from pyacptrak import *
Loop(2,1).plot()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158950730-1c74eb26-49b6-483a-b807-2f9887d9b7d8.png)

<pyacptrak.pyacptrak.track at 0x17daed040a0>

For loops wider than 1 it uses 90° tracks instead of 180°

```
from pyacptrak import *
Loop(3,2).plot()
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158950937-3a69abb0-5b25-4b3a-9b56-447b6b741304.png)

<pyacptrak.pyacptrak.track at 0x17daf0b8880>

The plot function also support rotation for loops

```
from pyacptrak import *
Loop(3,2).plot(190)
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101816677/158951085-4ce1008d-aa84-4158-98d0-e83406bb5326.png)

### Save the SVG files

It is possible to save the SVG file of any of the classes by chaining the method `save()`.

The `save()` accepts one argument to define the name of the output file, if no name is passed, the default filename will be the class name

```
from pyacptrak import *
Loop(3,2).plot(190).save()
```

Output: Saves a "Loop.svg" file

## Changes
### v0.0.4 (Latest release)
> #### General changes:
> - Bug fix: As a result of moving the "img" folder location in v0.0.3 the SVG images are not installed with the package, now this works correctly and the images are installed together with the package.

### v0.0.3
> #### General changes:
> - License changed from MIT to GNU GPLv3.
> - Added TypeError for addition and multiplication operators.
> - Added `typeguard` and `typing` packages to typecheck the methods.
> - Added `xmltodict` package to create the xml configuration files for the AS project.
> - Added `PARAM` variable to configure the exported files.
> - Reduced the size of SVG files.

> #### Segment class:
> - Change: Removed the `info` attribute.
> - New feature: The `info()` method was added to get the segment information.
> - Bug fix: Multiplying a segment object by an integer "n" would create a Track class object with "n" segments all pointing to the same segment object.

> #### Track class:
> - New feature: The `seg_prefix` argument (Optional) was added to the `Track` class to create the segment variable. The default value is "gSeg_".
> - New feature: The `seg_offset` argument (Optional) was added to the `Track` class to configure an offset for the segment variable. The default value is "1".
> - New feature: The `info()` method was added to get the track information.
> - Bug fix: Adding or multiplying Track objects would create a Track class object with elements pointing to the same segment objects

> #### Loop class:
> - New feature: Added addition and multiplication operators, the result will return an `Assembly` object.
> - Bug fix: The inherited `length()` method didn't work because the `Loop` class had a `length` attribute that was overwritting the method `length()` of the parent class `Track`.

> #### Assembly class:
> - New feature: Class added to the package
> - New feature: The `export()` method was added.
>   - The assembly configuration file (AsmCfg.assembly) will be generated.
>   - The shuttle stereotype file (ShCfg.shuttlestereotype) will be generated.
